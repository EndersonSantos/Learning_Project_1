An analysis of the Richest Atheletes since 1990 

## Overview
In this data set we have the top 10 most well paid atheletes throughout the years from different sports. We are going to use this data set to answer some interest questions.

## Ask
  We want to discovery some trend in the players yearnings and se if theres any correlation with sport, country, etc.
  + How the average salary has change over the years?
	
  + What Sport Shows up more often in the top 10?
	
  + What player Show's up more often in the top 10?
	
  - What country has the most top 1 players? 
	
  - What country has the average better salary?

## Prepare 
The data has been extracted from topendsports.com website. And, stored on kaggle's dataset that you can find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/forbes-highest-paid-athletes-19902019)

## Process 
This is a small dataset so we can easily do the whole process using excel(clean, analyse, and visualize). But, for learning purpose we are going to use SQL(Postgree) to clean, and analyse and then tableau to create a dataviz. And, we are going to use Python and its principals lybraries to data manupulation and dataviz(Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) to peform the same steps again using jupyter notebook.

## Analyse 
+ We see a trend on the earning throughout the year and we expect that the wages of the best playing keep growing throgh the following years.
+ We also see that most of the top 1 are from US. That makes sense once the sport who most appear on top 10 are very popular there for example basketball, american football and, baseball.
+ The sport that appear more often on top 10 is Basketball and the player who most appear on top 10 is Michael Jordan along with Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, and Saquille O'Neal. Basketeball is the hottest sport in terms of earnings since the 90's.
+ Something really interesting is that only in the last decade was that soccer players started to appear on top 10. It look's like soccer has been grown dramatically since the las the last decade
